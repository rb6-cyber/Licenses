# Licenses
ZaPobedu

This repo is a collection of free software licences of new types, i.e. those with dynamically configurable restrictions to make dynamically configurable groups of the software users be barred from the use of the software and its source code.

The motivation for that development grew from non-ligimate restrictions being placed by so called "democratic" Western governments and politicians on different people, companies and countries because of their nationality, ethnicity and political views.
The most recent and obvious example of non-legitimate so called "sanctions" was those economical and cultural restrictions and racial discriminations put on Russia as a country, as well as on its companies and citizens.
